# Calculator (1/17/2019)

This is a simple calculator app written by Matt's group at our Jan 17th, 2019 meetup.
The project is in the state where Matt ended the guided portion and allowed for
people to expand and hack on their implementation.

It is meant to add 1 + 1 to get 2. There is a huge bug (that was intentional).
See if you can find it, fix it, and add more features!
